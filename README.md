# Paint-Plugin WIP
 ## How to test
 To test this project, clone it and open the main unity scene. Once you've done this you should be able to press play and start painting on the scene using the mouse.
 ## What it is currently
 Currently a test scene is setup where you can set the brush to use (any image with read/write privileges) and paint on an infinite canvas.

 To do this, click the WORLD gameobject and then set the _brushTexture on the ArtManager script. 
 
 Once you've done this you can play and paint with the new brush!
